# Diabetes_Estimation_of_patients_with_machine_learning
#<Diabetes Disease Prediction using Machine Learning>#

Objective

We aim to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not using various attributes and other characteristics.

##The prediction of the critical disease diabetes, diabetes is ranked as the fifth deadliest disease worldwide.

 - Our main motivation was to help healthcare provider to predict the patients who have high chances of getting diabetic over the period of time.
 - As we see there are many health effects associated with diabetes, it was important to tackle it from the basic disease.
 - Our model tries to predict if the patient is prone to diabetes or not, taking health conditions as features.

## Installation

 - Download diabetes.csv
 - install jupyter notebook or use google colab
 - install required machine learning packages to read and process the scv file.
 - Pandas 0.23.4
 - Numpy 1.15.3
 - Matplotlib 2.2.2
 - Scikit-learn 0.20.0

## Preprocessing

 - Cleaning the data, includes removing the null values, taking care of the missing values.

## Machine Learning Models used

 - Decision Tree
 - SVM
 - Random forest
 - AdaBoost
 - Perceptron
 - Logistic Regression
 - KNN

## Result

 - Random forest classifier has the highest classification showing the accuracy 82%.
